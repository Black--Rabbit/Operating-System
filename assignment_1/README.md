A system call is written which takes two values and performs the following operations:


1)
                                    precondition 1:   3<Num1<1000
                                    
                                    precondition 2:   3<Num2<1000
  
                     If the precondition 1 and precondition 2 are ot met then 7 is returned
                     Else if precondition 1 is not met then returns 6
                     Else if precondition 2 is not met then returns 5]
                     Else execute the program and return the results accordingly.
                     
                     
2)                     
                    Finds out whether Num1 is a product of two prime numbers
                    
                    Finds out whether Num2 is a product of two prime numbers
                    
                                  If Num1 and Num2 are products of two prime numbers then returns 1
                                  Else if Num1 is a product of two prime number then returns 2
                                  Else if Num2 is a product of two prime number then returns 3
                                  Else returns 4
