Assignment 4 question 1

Name : Abhinav Misra

List of Files:
	1. input.c :  Is responsible for taking input.
	2. path.c : Calculates all the possible paths.
	3. header.h : Is the header file to link the other files.
	4. main.c : Driving code. Contains the main function.
	5. Makefile : Will compile the code.
	
Compiling :
	$make
Execute : 
	$./exec <file name>
	
Progress:
	The code successfully calculates the number of paths but for multiple paths the output is incorrect. 
	There could have been an approach to make a tree data structure for all the paths and then manipulate it to get all the paths
	but that would have defeated the purpose of the assignment as it would have been more of DSA than OS.
